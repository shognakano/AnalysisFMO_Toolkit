# AnalysisFMO_Toolkit
AnalysisFMO, which should enable a more efficient and convenient workflow with FMO data generated by quantum-chemical packages such as GAMESS, PAICS, and ABINIT-MP. AnalysisFMO consists of two separate units, RbAnalysisFMO, and the PyMOL plugins. The former can extract interfragment interaction energies (IFIEs) or pair interaction energies (PIEs) from the FMO output files generated by the aforementioned quantum-chemical packages. The PyMOL plugins enable visualization of IFIEs or PIEs in the protein structure in PyMOL.
