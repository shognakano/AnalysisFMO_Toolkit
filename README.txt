PyGAMESS is a PyMOL plug-in to represent PIEs calculated by GAMESS to protein structure on PyMOL. PyGAMESS is constituted by following two modes: ÅgAll pair modeÅh and ÅgSelected pair (PIEDA) modeÅh.


Attention!


Prior to run PyGAMESS, all users have to run GAMESS with referring to the following homepage (http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/). Then the output file must be converted to csv file by RbPaics developed by Takaki Tokiwa.


ÉgÉsÉbÉNÉX
Intermolecular interaction of protein/protein and protein/ligand affects to various their characters, such as protein stability, enzyme reactivity, enzyme inhibition and more. Estimation of the interaction quantitatively is important to design candidate of medicine and molecular probe. Here, fragment molecular orbital (FMO) is one of the method which can estimate the interaction energy by ab initio calculation. The calculated parameter, called inter fragment interaction energy (IFIE) or PIEs, could indicate the energy between ligand molecule and each amino acid residues in target protein, or residue-residue interaction in target proteins. The IFIEs can calculated several of already developed software, such as GAMESS and PAICS. Å@Å@ 
PyGAMESS is a PyMOL plug-in to represent PIEs calculated by GAMESS to protein structure on PyMOL. PyGAMESS is constituted by following two modes: ÅgAll pair modeÅh and ÅgSelected pair modeÅh. Utilizing PyGAMESSs, we can perform following things. 
(All pair mode) The PIEs between user-defined residue and other residues forming top five of stable/repulsive interaction could be represented on protein structure in PyMOL. 
(Selected pair mode) The intermolecular interaction could be represented on PyMOL between ligand and amino acid residues which located within the user defined distance. The interacting residues are colored with dependent on magnitude of IFIEs. 
To run PyGAMESS, users must install numpy in the system. In addition, users must obtain output file of GAMESS by running it with following the procedure as shown in GAMESS web site (http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/).

Introduction

Å@Å@ Ruby script (RbAnalysisFMO in AnalysisFMO Toolkit) for analysis the output file (*.out or *.log, and so on) of the fragment molecule orbital (FMO) calcualtion packages (GAMESS (the general atomic and molecular electronic structure system), Paics (the parallelized ab initio calculation system), and ABINIT-MP (the ABINT ab initio multi-processor)). The output file of FMO calculation is composed of various data in an ASCII (text) format: run time parameter, atomic coordinate, and inter fragment interaction energies (IFIEs) and/or pair interaction energies (PIEs). It is necessary to extract IFIEs or PIEs from the FMO output file due to analyze and visualize. RbAnalysisFMO is able to analyze and extract IFIEs or PIEs from the FMO output file. The GAMESS program package can calculate PIEs and The PAICS program package can calculate IFIEs. ABINIT-MP program package can calculate IFIEs but ABINIT-MP Open series can calculate IFIEs and PIEs.

 Note that this analyzed csv file (*.csv) is visualized on PyMOL program by PyPaics, PyGAMESS, or PyABINIT-MP programs and developed by Shogo Nakano.

 There are two analysis modes in this ruby script as following:
ÅEÅhSelected-pairsÅh mode in Ågone-dimensional tableÅh:
This mode can be analyzed energies as fragments-target interaction from the FMO out file. Target is fragment, ligand, peptide, H2O, ion, and so on. In the case of Paics calculation, it is used Ågfrag_calc_pairÅh option (selection of the fragment pairs, such as fragment number 1-100 (All) and fragment number 101 (target)). The details of the Ågfrag_calc_pairÅh option are described in P. 14 the Chapter2 ÅgINPUTÅh at http://www.paics.net/pdf/manual.pdf. This mode saves as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values format, *.csv) and TXT (ASCII (text) format, *.txt) files in one-dimensional table. Energy data is plotted bar graph using the gnuplot program. The PS file is converted the PDF file using ps2pdf program after this plotted graph is saved as the PS file by gnuplot.




ÅEÅhAll-pairsÅh mode in Ågtwo-dimensional tableÅh:
This mode can be analyzed energies as (all) fragments-(all) fragments, which may be included ligand, peptide, H2O and so on, interaction from the FMO out file. In the case of PAICS calculation, it is not used Ågfrag_calc_pairÅh option (that is, results of PAICS for all fragment calculation). This mode saves as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values format, *.csv) and TXT (ASCII (text) format,, *.txt) files in two-dimensional table. And, Energy data is plotted 2D graph using gnuplot program.
